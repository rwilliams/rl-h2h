# Rocket League Stats API — Reference

Source: <https://www.rocketleague.com/en/developer/stats-api> (captured 2026-05-01).

The Stats API is a **local WebSocket** that the Rocket League client opens
while a match is in progress. It broadcasts JSON messages at a configurable
periodic rate plus event-driven messages. Third-party tools (broadcaster
HUDs, overlays, trackers, etc.) ingest these messages.

---

## 1. Enabling the API (player-side setup)

Edit `<Install Dir>\TAGame\Config\DefaultStatsAPI.ini` **before launching the
client**. Changes made while the game is running require a restart.

| Setting          | Type  | Default       | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PacketSendRate` | float | `0` (disabled)| Number of `UpdateState` packets per second. Must be > 0 to enable the socket. Capped at 120. |
| `Port`           | int   | `49123`       | Local TCP port the WebSocket listens on.                                                     |

Connect to: `ws://127.0.0.1:<Port>` (default `ws://127.0.0.1:49123`).

## 2. Message envelope

Every message follows the same envelope:

```json
{
  "Event": "EventName",
  "Data":  { /* event-specific payload */ }
}
```

### Field-visibility conventions

- **`CONDITIONAL`** — only present when relevant (e.g. `Attacker` only when a
  player is demolished, `Assister` only when a goal had an assist).
- **`SPECTATOR`** — only present if the local client is spectating or on the
  same team as the player. Not visible for opponents during normal play.

### Gotcha: double-encoded `Data` payload (observed in practice)

In this project we found the `Data` payload arrives as a **JSON string**
inside the envelope rather than an inline object — i.e. it must be
`json.loads`'d a second time. See commit `f7d6344` ("Decode the
double-encoded Data payload") and the parser in `rl_h2h.py`. Always be
defensive: try parsing `Data` as a string first, fall back to using it
directly if it's already a dict.

### Connection gotcha

The websockets handshake probe sometimes fails or hangs; in this project we
skip the WS probe and connect via raw TCP (`c9c27ea`).

## 3. Tick message

### `UpdateState`

Sent `PacketSendRate` times per second. This is the "current state of the
match" snapshot used to drive HUDs/overlays.

Top-level shape:

```jsonc
{
  "Event": "UpdateState",
  "Data": {
    "MatchGuid": "…",            // online/LAN matches only
    "Players": [ /* per-player */ ],
    "Game":    { /* match-level state */ }
  }
}
```

### Gameplay events

#### `BallHit`
Sent **one frame after** the ball is hit.

```jsonc
{
  "Players": [ { "Name": "...", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 } ],   // players who hit on that frame
  "Ball": {
    "PreHitSpeed":  0.0,
    "PostHitSpeed": 1450.2,
    "Location": { "X": -512, "Y": 100, "Z": 200 }
  }
}
```

#### `ClockUpdatedSeconds`
In-game clock changed.

```jsonc
{ "TimeSeconds": 180, "bOvertime": false }
```

#### `CrossbarHit`
Ball hit a crossbar.

```jsonc
{
  "BallLocation": { "X": 120, "Y": -2944, "Z": 320 },
  "BallSpeed":   870.3,
  "ImpactForce": 127.5,                 // relative to crossbar normal
  "BallLastTouch": {
    "Player": { "Name": "...", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 },
    "Speed":  120
  }
}
```

#### `GoalScored`

```jsonc
{
  "GoalSpeed":      87.3,               // ball speed when crossing line
  "GoalTime":      127.5,               // length of previous round, seconds

  "Scorer":   { "Name": "...", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 },
  "Assister": { "Name": "...", "Shortcut": 3, "TeamNum": 0 },   // CONDITIONAL
  "BallLastTouch": {
    "Player": { "Name": "...", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 },
    "Speed":  125
  }
}
```

##### Detecting own-goals (and the placeholder-event quirk)

The API has **no own-goal flag**, and RL's accounting model doesn't
treat own-goals as a category at all: every goal is credited to a
player on the team whose score went up. So when you put the ball in
your own net, `Scorer.TeamNum` is the *opposing* team's number, and
`Scorer.Name` is whichever opposing player RL picks (typically the last
opponent who touched the ball before you deflected it in). The
score-delta heuristic does **not** work for this reason: by the time
the score updates, RL has already rebadged the goal as a normal goal
for the other team.

The only reliable signal is **`BallLastTouch.Player.TeamNum`**:

- Compare it against `Scorer.TeamNum`.
- If they match → normal goal.
- If they differ → own-goal. The actual "scorer" (in the colloquial
  sense — the player who put the ball in their own net) is
  `BallLastTouch.Player.Name`, **not** `Scorer.Name`.

**Placeholder GoalScored events.** RL emits *two* `GoalScored` events
around each goal:

1. The real one, with full `Scorer` info.
2. A placeholder, with `Scorer.Name == ""` and `Scorer.TeamNum == 0`
   (Python's default int).

For a normal goal, the real event arrives first and the placeholder
follows after the kickoff. For an own-goal (where RL has to compute
credit during the replay), the placeholder arrives first and the real
event follows once credit is assigned. Either way, **drop placeholders
where `Scorer.Name` is empty** — they're not actionable.

This is what `rl_h2h.py` does in `StatsClient._classify_goal_scored`.

#### `StatfeedEvent`
Fires whenever a player earns a stat (demos, saves, etc).

```jsonc
{
  "EventName":    "Demolish",           // asset name (e.g. "Demolish", "Save")
  "Type":         "Demolition",         // localized display label
  "MainTarget":      { "Name": "PlayerA", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 },
  "SecondaryTarget": { "Name": "PlayerB", "Shortcut": 2, "TeamNum": 1 }   // CONDITIONAL
}
```

## 5. Common shapes

**Player ref** (used in `Scorer`, `Assister`, `MainTarget`, `Attacker`, etc.):
```jsonc
{ "Name": "string", "Shortcut": 1, "TeamNum": 0 }
```

**Vector**:
```jsonc
{ "X": 0.0, "Y": 0.0, "Z": 0.0 }
```

**`PrimaryId`** is `Platform|Uid|Splitscreen` — split on `|` to get the
platform (`Steam`, `Epic`, `PS4`, `XboxOne`, `Switch`, …) and persistent uid.
Only `UpdateState.Players[].PrimaryId` carries this; event payloads only
expose `Name`/`Shortcut`/`TeamNum`.

**Units**: speeds are in **Unreal Units/second** (~100 UU = 1 metre).
Supersonic threshold ≈ `2200` UU/s.

## 6. Practical notes for this project

- The "websocket" is local-only; no auth. Despite the official wording, **the
  wire format is raw TCP NDJSON** — RFC 6455 WebSocket handshake is not
  honored. Connect with `asyncio.open_connection`, parse with
  `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode()` over a rolling buffer.
- `Data` is **double-encoded JSON** in practice — parse the envelope, then
  `json.loads` the `Data` field again. (`f7d6344`)
- Be defensive in the `UpdateState` parser: spectator-only fields and
  conditional objects (`Attacker`, `Target`, `Assister`) may be missing —
  type-check every nested access. (`6e38e7f`)
- One bad message must not kill the client — wrap per-message handling
  in a try/except and keep the loop alive. (`3b3776d`)
- Event order during a goal:
  `BallHit` → `GoalScored` → `GoalReplayStart` → `GoalReplayWillEnd` →
  `GoalReplayEnd` → `CountdownBegin` → `RoundStarted`.
- **Doc/wire mismatch**: the doc lists `GoalReplayWillEnd`, the wire emits
  `ReplayWillEnd` (no `Goal` prefix). We don't dispatch on it; flagging in
  case Psyonix fixes one or the other later.
- Match end signal for persisting H2H records: `MatchEnded` (carries
  `WinnerTeamNum`); `MatchDestroyed` is a fallback when the user quits early.
- `Arena` is the asset name (`Stadium_P`, `TrainStation_Night_P`, …). Pretty
  names live in `rl_h2h.py` (`ARENA_BASE` + variant suffixes).
- `MatchGuid` is **only present for online/LAN matches** — don't rely on it
  for offline/freeplay/exhibition.
- `Game.Teams[].Score` is the live team score; capture it on every
  `UpdateState` and snapshot at `MatchEnded` for the final tally.
- `Game.Teams[].ColorPrimary` is the in-game team color (no `#`). May be
  gray (`959595`) in private/training maps; fall back to defaults in that case.
- **Self detection.** The wire has no "this is me" flag. Heuristic:
  spectator-only fields appear only for the local client's team. In 1v1, the
  single player on `my_team` is "me" — record their `PrimaryId` once
  (`Platform|Uid` after dropping the splitscreen suffix) and reuse forever.
  In 2v2/3v3 we can't auto-detect from one match without prior data.
- **PrimaryId platforms observed**: `Epic|<32-char-hex>|0`, `PS4|<numeric>|0`,
  `XboxOne|<numeric>|0`, `Steam|<steamid64>|0`. The third segment is
  splitscreen index — strip it for cross-session identity.
- **What's NOT in the API**: MMR, rank, division, playlist/queue type, party
  composition, replay file path. For MMR you have to scrape Tracker Network
  by `PrimaryId`.
- **Audit (2026-05-02)**: dumped every envelope verbatim during a casual 1v1
  to confirm there's no undocumented queue-type field. Verified absent across
  `MatchCreated`, `MatchInitialized`, `CountdownBegin`, `RoundStarted`,
  `UpdateState.{Game,Players,Teams}`, `BallHit`, `StatfeedEvent`,
  `GoalScored`, `CrossbarHit`, `ClockUpdatedSeconds`, `MatchEnded`,
  `MatchDestroyed`. Every event carries `MatchGuid` plus its event-specific
  payload — nothing else identifies playlist or ranked-vs-casual. Per-game
  MMR attribution therefore can't disambiguate ranked from casual matches
  played in the same TRN snapshot window from API data alone; either rely on
  a manual user toggle or infer from MMR-motion correlation.
